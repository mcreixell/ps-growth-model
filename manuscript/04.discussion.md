## Discussion

Quantifying drug response is a fundamental step in pharmacology and cancer biology. Two major phenotypic changes we can observe as cellular responses to drugs are cell growth and death. Each response occurs to a different extent by drugs and contributes to the overall effect of drugs. For efficacious cancer treatments, a single or multiple drugs should optimally modulate both phenotypes. In this paper, we demonstrate that the lack of measurements for cell population dynamics, such as cell division and death rates, results large uncertainty in predicting drug effect. There is increasing concerns to aggressive behavior of residual cell populations after a treatment and this brings the attention to the importance of measuring more detailed cell fates. By simultaneously measuring cell growth and death, it is possible to dissect cell fates driven by a drug and identify cell population dynamics that largely contributes to drug effect.

The time-lapse imaging of cells with two specific cell death markers facilitates detection of quantitative cell proliferation and death in kinetics, which further enables building a mathematical model to predict cell population dynamics. This method can be applied to high-throughput screening and genome-scale functional genetics. In this work, we characterized cellular responses against number of chemotherapeutic and targeted compounds using this method. Many of chemotherapeutic agents are known to kill highly proliferative cancer cells by inhibiting the cell cycle, resulting in both live cell number decrease and cell death induction. Consistent with this, we observed anti-proliferation and cell death by doxorubicin and vinorelbine in our experiment with a non-small cell lung cancer cell line. Beyond this observation, we were able to capture a difference in cellular drug response between the two compounds by our method. Doxorubicin strongly reduced cell division rate, and vinorelbine strongly increased cell death rate to kill the cells. While both drugs exhibited similar phenotypic changes, the difference exist in the process

(understanding mechanism of action of cytotoxic agent, dissecting cell death mechanism) Chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin and vinorelbine, kill highly proliferative cancer cells by inhibiting the cell cycle. Doxorubicin is known to induce DNA double strand break, which leads to cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The consequent effects of doxorubicin differ depending on the p53 status in cells [@pmid:25158956]. After the G2 arrest, mitotic entry is prevented in p53 wild-type cells, and cells proceed to G1 state and permanently exit the cell cycle (senescence?). However, in p53 null cells, cells enter mitosis but fail to undergo cytokinesis and trigger apoptosis in G1 phase. H1299 cells used in (fig. [@fig:measure]) lack p53 expression, therefore, we anticipate that the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H1299 cells to occur after progressing through G2 arrest, mitotic entry and failed cytokinesis. In addition, a study with mouse leukemia P388 cells showed that cells synchronized in S or G2/M phase are more sensitive to doxorubicin than G1 phase [@pmid:8622633], which further suggests the dependency of doxorubicin effect on cell cycle. Vinorelbine is an antimitotic agent that prevents microtubule polymerization, thereby inhibiting cell division during metaphase. In contrast to doxorubicin, vinorelbine induces apoptosis independent of cell cycle and p53 status [@pmid:22399804]. These differences may explain the late onset of apoptosis by doxorubicin compared to vinorelbine in our experiment.
