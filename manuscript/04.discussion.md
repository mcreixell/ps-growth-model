## Discussion

Here, we demonstrate how a high-throughput assay can be paired with analysis to quantify both the growth and death effects of drug response. Applying this analysis, we identify that compounds can have distinct outcomes by specifically driving growth, death, or mixed effects (fig. {@fig:targeted}). Cell death can also take distinct forms, which can easily be quantified as relatively more or less apoptotic (fig. {@fig:measure}). Importantly, cell viability measurements alone cannot distinguish these divergent outcomes (fig. {@fig:distinguish}). Further, additive drug interactions in terms of cell growth or death can appear synergistic when only assessed through cell viability (fig. {@fig:last}). Overall, these results show that cytotoxic drug response should be assessed by the distinct phenotypes of cell growth and death while demonstrating an approach to do so.

The approach here will benefit from improvements in the single-cell resolution of drug response and more exactly distinguishing cell death programs. Cell-to-cell variability impacts both drug response and the development of resistance [@doi:10.1016/j.coisb.2019.09.002] and single-cell technologies have enabled in-depth molecular analyses of this heterogeneity [@pmid:27124452; @doi:10.1186/s13059-018-1576-0]. Within a tumor population, drug treatment can dynamically shift the balance of variability present, and so dynamic information will likely be critical [@pmid:20371346; @pmid:21854987]. Automated cell tracking would enable drug response quantification, with single-cell resolution, while preserving the lineage relationship of cells [@doi:10.1101/373258; @doi:10.1101/797225]. While we distinguish relatively more or less apoptotic cell death here, various cell death programs exist [@doi:10.1038/s41418-017-0012-4]. Improved methods to visualize distinct forms of cell death in populations of cells will allow distinct forms of cell death to be separately quantified [@pmid:28264914].

Separating these phenotypic outcomes provides future opportunities for cancer treatment. A more detailed view of phenotypic drug response should enable treatment optimization both in a population- and patient-specific manner [@pmid:29245013]. For maximally-effective cancer treatment, single or combination treatments should likely modulate both phenotypes. Purely cytostatic therapy leaves drug persister cells able to undergo genetic or epigenetic changes giving rise to resistance [@pmid:26828195]. On the other hand, cell death may not overcome the replenishment of tumor cells at toxicity-limiting doses. Further, the microenvironment and host immune response to cancer are potently influenced by the routes of cell death [@doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.aaw2004; @doi:10.1172/JCI76375]. These methods can be applied not only *in vitro* but in more complex, translationally-relevant models such as organoids and *in vivo* [@doi:10.1038/s42003-019-0305-x]. By doing so, treatments could be tailored to not just maximally reduce cell viability, but optimize cytotoxicity and cell death programs to mount a host response.
