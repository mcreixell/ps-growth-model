# Methods

All analysis was implemented in Python, and can be found at [https://github.com/meyer-lab/ps-growth-model](https://github.com/meyer-lab/ps-growth-model), release 1.0 (doi: [00.0000/arc0000000](https://doi.org/doi-url)).

## Cell culture

## Time-lapse microscopy

## Growth model inference


$$ \frac{\delta L}{\delta t} = $$

$$ \frac{\delta E}{\delta t} = $$

$$ \frac{\delta D}{\delta t} = $$

Integrating these equations provides the following solution:

$$ L(t) = $$

$$ E(t) = $$

$$ D(t) = $$
