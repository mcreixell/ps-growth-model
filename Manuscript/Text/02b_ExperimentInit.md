## High-throughput measurements of cell death help interrogate compound response

With confidence that additional measurements would provide more detailed information about the response of cancer cells to compound treatment, we extended our experimental measurements to incorporate multiple measurements of cell death. In addition to quantifying the number of cells over time by bright field, we utilized fluorescent Annexin V to quantify phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and a membrane-impermeable DNA dye to quantify cell permeabilization ([@fig:FigTwo]A). Measurements of doxorubicin response showed a strong reduction in the number of cells ([@fig:FigTwo]B), closely matching that observed by independent measurement ([@fig:Motivate]C). At the same time, we observed little increase in either Annevin V or DNA dye signal over the course of the assay ([@fig:FigTwo]B). Fitting these data to a model of cell growth and death, we correspondingly observed a strong decrease in the inferred rate of growth, while the rate of cell death only increased modestly ([@fig:FigTwo]C).

We next measured response to another chemotherapy, vinorelbine, again observing a dose-dependent decrease in the number of live cells observed ([@fig:FigTwo]D). At the same time, we observed an increase in both the abundance of Annexin V and DNA stain signal. This was reflected in our subsequent analysis, with a corresponding increase in the inferred death rate ([@fig:FigTwo]E). TODO: Do we want to say anything about differences in mechanism?

We then utilized CFSE dilution to verify the distinct effects on the growth rates of cells inferred by our analysis ([@fig:FigTwo]F). The resultant CFSE dilution measurements corresponded well to the inferred growth rate of our model, further supporting that these measurements can quantify both growth and death rate effects on cells.

TODO: Western blot validation
