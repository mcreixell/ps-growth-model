## High-throughput measurements of cell death help interrogate compound response

With confidence that additional measurements would provide more detailed information about the response of cancer cells to compound treatment, we extended our experimental measurements to incorporate multiple measurements of cell death. In addition to quantifying the number of cells over time by bright field, we utilized fluorescent Annexin V to quantify phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and a membrane-impermeable DNA dye to quantify cell permeabilization.
