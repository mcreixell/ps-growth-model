# Introduction

Quantifying cellular response to treatment with endogenous or therapeutic compounds is critical to understanding these agent's mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy. In the case of cancer treatments, and often with other diseases, compounds are evaluated by quantifying the number of cells after a short period of time using direct or surrogate measurements. However, quantities beyond the number and viability of cells provide extremely valuable information about cellular response. Compounds such as targeted kinase inhibitors are known to often operate through cell division rates, as opposed to promoting cell death, allowing for the survival of persister cell populations which enable resistance development [@Hata:2016dp, Sharma:2010ge, Shaffer:2017a]. Cell death can occur via a variety of mechanisms, including apoptosis and necroptosis, and selection among these outcomes can potently modulate the immunogenicity of a cancer [@Gotwals:2017kj]. Combinations of compounds are typically evaluated for their ability to enact greater effects than either compound alone, however how this might be evaluated when quantifying multiple cellular phenotypes is unclear.

Here, we show that measuring quantities beyond cell number over time can provide valuable information for interpreting the response of cells to single and combination compound treatments. Through analysis taking into account the compound-induced changes in rates of cell growth and death, we propose a framework for quantifying sensitivity to compounds and combination effect. This approach reveals extensive differences in cell response otherwise hidden by simply quantifying cell number. Of course, trade offs exist for the breadth versus depth of analysis that can be performed to characterize cell-compound response. However, we believe these results demonstrate the need and an approach to more exactly quantify the nature of cell-compound interactions.
