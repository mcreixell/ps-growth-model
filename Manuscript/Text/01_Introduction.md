# Introduction

Our understanding and evaluation of cellular responses to compound treatment revolves around quantifying changes in cell number over time.







However, quantities beyond the number and viability of cells provide extremely valuable information about cellular response. 

- Apoptosis vs. immunogenic cell death
- Persister cell populations
- Clonal selection
- Resistance mechanisms




Here, we show that measuring quantities beyond cell number over time can provide valuable information
